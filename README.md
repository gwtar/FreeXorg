FreeXorg is xorg-like xorg that was neutral os, free, open source, simple, and small

it is made because of the problem xorg has and xorg was old and unmaintainable which why wayland want to replace it.

but wayland has some issue, see wayland is just a set of rule just like OpenGL for dev to follow meaning that
the dev can manage everything the way he wants and because of this, this can lead to unreuseable code and 
un-universal because for example I want to set my wallpaper, well on xorg I just need to install for example
nitrogen and done but on wayland it was depended on how the developer manage the wallpapering on their wayland
WM, ok just that sorry for bad english
